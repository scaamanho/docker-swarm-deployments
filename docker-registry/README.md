# Configuration

## Docker registry IP
change `192.168.99.106` for your docker-machine ip

## Docker Registry Front-End
This stack comes with 2 docker-registy frontends.

* docker-registry-browser
* docker-registry-frontend

Both are similar, and have similar functionalitys. So if you not want one of them, you can just remove it
